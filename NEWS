Gaim for Qtopia Release Notes
-----------------------------

version 0.1 (Sunday, 10-August-2003):
	* Initial release.

	Christian: Wow, finally an actual release of Gaim for Qtopia! The
		Gaim developers have spent the past 10 months or so working on
		our core/UI split so things like this would be possible, and
		here's the first result. Yes, this is a native port of Gaim to
		the Qtopia Embedded environment for Linux-based PDAs. It's
		pretty good for a 0.1 release, but many things won't be there,
		such as blocking users, adding chats to your buddy list, and a
		tray icon. I'll get to those in time. For now, enjoy, and if
		there are any bugs (I'm sure there will be ;), please click
		the Bug Reports link on our site at
		http://qpe-gaim.sourceforge.net/.
