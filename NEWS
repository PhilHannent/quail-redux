	Christian: It's not too long after the previous release, but there
		have been many bug fixes and feature enhancements. The UI has
		also been cleaned up a bit. For example, it should be easier
		to tell which accounts are signed on and which aren't. It's a
		pretty good 0.2 release.  0.3 is going to have new goodies,
		such as new message notification and preferences. As always,
		if you have questions, please check the FAQ.  Bug reports go
		to the trackers.

version 0.1 (Sunday, 10-August-2003):
	* Initial release.

	Christian: Wow, finally an actual release of Gaim for Qtopia! The
		Gaim developers have spent the past 10 months or so working on
		our core/UI split so things like this would be possible, and
		here's the first result. Yes, this is a native port of Gaim to
		the Qtopia Embedded environment for Linux-based PDAs. It's
		pretty good for a 0.1 release, but many things won't be there,
		such as blocking users, adding chats to your buddy list, and a
		tray icon. I'll get to those in time. For now, enjoy, and if
		there are any bugs (I'm sure there will be ;), please click
		the Bug Reports link on our site at
